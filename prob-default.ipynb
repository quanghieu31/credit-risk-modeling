    "The project focuses on the probability of loan defaults in the banking industry. It is my practice regarding a predictive probablity-related problem using some machine learning models. There are three main credit risk models on theory (exposure at default, probability of default, and loss given default). In my analysis, I will focus solely on the probability of default. <br> <br> The goal is to build/review some models that lenders can use to help make the best financial decisions on dealing with high-risk borrowers. In particularly, I will try to predict the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years. <br><br> Later, I will compare these models with non-ML models (hopefully I have the time and effort)\n",
